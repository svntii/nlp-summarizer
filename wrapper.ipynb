Secy.\\n Goldwyn', 'thread_id': 2103, 'timestamp': 950062980000, 'to': ['Mark Schroeder']}, {'body': 'The IPP in Gaza is progressing albeit somewhat behind schedule.  This \\ncombined cycle power plant is the first infrastructure development project in \\nGaza and the first by a major Western company anywhere in \"Palestine.\"  There \\nare several issues which should be addressed and may be raised during the \\nSecretary\\'s visit.\\n\\n1.  All equipment for the plant must transit Israel.  We have been assured by \\nthe Israelis that movement of the equipment will not be impeded as long as it \\nis on the list of equipment we provide them.  That said, there are countless \\nopportunities for equipment to be delayed in Israel awaiting clearance, \\nwhether on the list or not.  First power could be delayed indefinitely if the \\nIsraelis choose to do so for political, security, or other reasons.\\n\\n2.  Fuel for the plant, once operational, will also transit Israel.  Again, \\ndisruption of the fuel supply for any length of time will in effect pull the \\nplug on power in Gaza.  Gas from Egypt has been discussed; it remains to be \\nseen if that will be a reality anytime soon.\\n\\n3.  Although not officially from the Israeli government, we have been told \\nthat as soon as the first watt of power from the plant is produced, the \\nIsraelis will turn off supply of electricity to Gaza.  The current \\nconsumption is about 110MW.  The first phase of the plant will produce 40MW.  \\nThis appears to be the beginning of a power supply arrangement whereby Israel \\nsells Gaza electricity to make up the difference.  That electricity is likely \\nto be more expensive than that which the plant will supply; Enron could well \\nend up being blamed for the higher cost.\\n\\n4.  Water is another critical issue.  The Palestinians want their own supply \\nof fresh water which must necessarily be desalinated.  Israel is currently \\nselling water to Gaza; it is not in Israel\\'s best interest to lose this \\ncustomer, therefore she may attempt to delay a desalination project.\\n\\n5.  OPIC project funding is problematical.  Since they originally invited \\nEnron to take on this project, they should necessarily also be involved.  \\nLack of OPIC support could jeopardize other project financing and drive up \\ncosts.\\n\\n6.  The Israelis must also \"approve\" the environmental impact of the plant.  \\nThe plant will meet or exceed World Bank guidelines, more so when operating \\non gas.  While not a probem at this point, the Israelis could delay \\nconstruction/operation over environmental \"concerns.\"\\n\\nAndrew is the lead developer for this project and may have other issues for \\nconsideration.

Secy. \\nGoldwyn\\n\\nThe IPP in Gaza is progressing albeit somewhat behind schedule.  This \\ncombined cycle power plant is the first infrastructure development project in \\nGaza and the first by a major Western company anywhere in \"Palestine.\"  There \\nare several issues which should be addressed and may be raised during the \\nSecretary\\'s visit.\\n\\n1.  All equipment for the plant must transit Israel.  We have been assured by \\nthe Israelis that movement of the equipment will not be impeded as long as it \\nis on the list of equipment we provide them.  That said, there are countless \\nopportunities for equipment to be delayed in Israel awaiting clearance, \\nwhether on the list or not.  First power could be delayed indefinitely if the \\nIsraelis choose to do so for political, security, or other reasons.\\n\\n2.  Fuel for the plant, once operational, will also transit Israel.  Again, \\ndisruption of the fuel supply for any length of time will in effect pull the \\nplug on power in Gaza.  Gas from Egypt has been discussed; it remains to be \\nseen if that will be a reality anytime soon.\\n\\n3.  Although not officially from the Israeli government, we have been told \\nthat as soon as the first watt of power from the plant is produced, the \\nIsraelis will turn off supply of electricity to Gaza.  The current \\nconsumption is about 110MW.  The first phase of the plant will produce 40MW.  \\nThis appears to be the beginning of a power supply arrangement whereby Israel \\nsells Gaza electricity to make up the difference.  That electricity is likely \\nto be more expensive than that which the plant will supply; Enron could well \\nend up being blamed for the higher cost.\\n\\n4.  Water is another critical issue.  The Palestinians want their own supply \\nof fresh water which must necessarily be desalinated.  Israel is currently \\nselling water to Gaza; it is not in Israel\\'s best interest to lose this \\ncustomer, therefore she may attempt to delay a desalination project.\\n\\n5.  OPIC project funding is problematical.  Since they originally invited \\nEnron to take on this project, they should necessarily also be involved.  \\nLack of OPIC support could jeopardize other project financing and drive up \\ncosts.\\n\\n6.  The Israelis must also \"approve\" the environmental impact of the plant.  \\nThe plant will meet or exceed World Bank guidelines, more so when operating \\non gas.  While not a probem at this point, the Israelis could delay \\nconstruction/operation over environmental \"concerns.\"\\n\\nAndrew is the lead developer for this project and may have other issues for \\nconsideration.  Thanks.

This is why I generated an early e-mail \\non the Gaza project.  I am now trying to meet with my new team members, and \\nclients/customers in the organisation.  I am headed to Houston on Sunday, for \\n3 days of meetings, and first week of March begin a journey that will take me \\nto most parts of East Asia/Australia.  Any suggestions on how (where) we get \\ntogether, and do you think it is a high priority, or not urgent.  It is not \\nthat I am looking to avoid a trip, but e-mails like those below suggest that \\nI can be kept well-informed without flying somewhere just to say \"hello\".  I \\nknow Mac is in Dubai.  I can fly there, or you can come to London (or are \\nthere others I should also meet in Dubai?).  Andrew - where are you based?  \\nIf in Dubai, then does it make sense for me to come to you?  Sooner rather \\nthan later, or no urgency?  If in Houston, should we try to meet next week?  \\nOr are you in still some other location?

Secy. \\nGoldwyn  \\n\\nmac-\\n\\ni have a slightly different view on your point #4.  the israelis are actually \\npushing for a palestinian water project as it will greatly strengthen the \\nisraeli position in the land settlement discussions in the peace talks.  the \\nPNA is saying that they need more land in the west bank in order to gain more \\naccess to aquifers under the land.  the isaelis want a desal project for the \\nPNA so that they can claim that the PNA has a larger water base, and thus \\ndoes not need to have more land for access to more water.  the issue is that \\nthere is not practical way in which gaza generated water can efficiently \\nreach the west bank, thus a water project in gaza should really be a moot \\npoint in this discussion, although it will not be due to the lack of \\nrationale to their discussions.\\n\\ni think that it is worth pointing out that the US consulate and embassy in \\nisrael have been helpful to us.  from the macro level, there needs to be more \\nproactive cooperation between the PNA and GOI on this project (due to the \\nlogistical and technical reasons that mac pointed out below).  furthermore, \\nit it worth noting that the PNA need to be more willing to adapt their \\nstandards to be more in line with large international transactions, as the \\nlocal process that they wish to cling to is very cumbersome, and will not \\nbenefit the PNA by attracting large scale foreign investment.\\n\\nplease let me know if you wish to discuss this further.\\n\\nandrew\\n\\n\\n   \\n\\tEnron International\\n\\t\\n\\tFrom:  Mac McClelland                           02/09/2000 10:55 AM\\n\\t\\n\\nTo: Mark Schroeder@ECT, Joe Hillings@ENRON, Steven J Kean@EES, Scott \\nReblitz/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Lora Sullivan@ENRON, Chris \\nLong@ENRON\\ncc: Rick Bergsieker/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Andrew \\nMakk/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Jeffrey \\nHammad/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Terence H \\nThorn/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, mlanoce@enron.com @ \\nENRON_DEVELOPMENT \\n\\nSubject: Re: Department of Energy Pre-departure Briefing w/ Asst. Secy. \\nGoldwyn\\n\\nThe IPP in Gaza is progressing albeit somewhat behind schedule.  This \\ncombined cycle power plant is the first infrastructure development project in \\nGaza and the first by a major Western company anywhere in \"Palestine.\"  There \\nare several issues which should be addressed and may be raised during the \\nSecretary\\'s visit.\\n\\n1.  All equipment for the plant must transit Israel.  We have been assured by \\nthe Israelis that movement of the equipment will not be impeded as long as it \\nis on the list of equipment we provide them.  That said, there are countless \\nopportunities for equipment to be delayed in Israel awaiting clearance, \\nwhether on the list or not.  First power could be delayed indefinitely if the \\nIsraelis choose to do so for political, security, or other reasons.\\n\\n2.  Fuel for the plant, once operational, will also transit Israel.  Again, \\ndisruption of the fuel supply for any length of time will in effect pull the \\nplug on power in Gaza.  Gas from Egypt has been discussed; it remains to be \\nseen if that will be a reality anytime soon.\\n\\n3.  Although not officially from the Israeli government, we have been told \\nthat as soon as the first watt of power from the plant is produced, the \\nIsraelis will turn off supply of electricity to Gaza.  The current \\nconsumption is about 110MW.  The first phase of the plant will produce 40MW.  \\nThis appears to be the beginning of a power supply arrangement whereby Israel \\nsells Gaza electricity to make up the difference.  That electricity is likely \\nto be more expensive than that which the plant will supply; Enron could well \\nend up being blamed for the higher cost.\\n\\n4.  Water is another critical issue.  The Palestinians want their own supply \\nof fresh water which must necessarily be desalinated.  Israel is currently \\nselling water to Gaza; it is not in Israel\\'s best interest to lose this \\ncustomer, therefore she may attempt to delay a desalination project.\\n\\n5.  OPIC project funding is problematical.  Since they originally invited \\nEnron to take on this project, they should necessarily also be involved.  \\nLack of OPIC support could jeopardize other project financing and drive up \\ncosts.\\n\\n6.  The Israelis must also \"approve\" the environmental impact of the plant.  \\nThe plant will meet or exceed World Bank guidelines, more so when operating \\non gas.  While not a probem at this point, the Israelis could delay \\nconstruction/operation over environmental \"concerns.\"\\n\\nAndrew is the lead developer for this project and may have other issues for \\nconsideration.  Thanks.
